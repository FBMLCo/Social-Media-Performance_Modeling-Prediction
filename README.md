# Social-Media-Performance_Modelling-Prediction
### Overview
> * The usage of social media is now well embeded in the communication and marketing strategies of many companies and brands. Marketing teams are familiar with social media listening and a set of standard Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) such as number of posts, number of followers. However, there are a lot of unchartered areas which could be explored by data science and applied machine learning to reveal not obvious or hidden pattern in social media data. It would help companies to better understand clients, stakeholders or influencers' dynamics.

### Main idea and goals:
> * This project aims at analysing a set of social media corporate communication from RELX Group (worldwide leader of information solutions: Elsevier, LexisNexis, Reed Exhibitions) and its main competitors (Clarivate, Wolters Kluwer, Informa, Pearson and Thomson Reuters)
* The objective is to better understand social media post performance (e.g. tweet post) combining different types of data (e.g. source and author of the post, context and nature of the topics discussed or subject pushed)
* The main goal is to evaluate at least 2 modeling approaches combining "standard machine learning" and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in order to identify social media performance drivers and consequently potentially predict the performance of a post
